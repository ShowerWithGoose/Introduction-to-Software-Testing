This causes non-leaf nodes to be printed AFTER their children, and more critically, it prints ALL nodes that are leaves at the moment of visiting, but due to the structure of the recursion, it does not perform an in-order traversal. The problem requires outputting leaf nodes from left to right, which corresponds to in-order traversal. However, this function visits left and right subtrees only if the current node is NOT a leaf, and then prints the current node regardless. This leads to printing non-leaf nodes as well if they become leaves during traversal (which they don't), but more importantly, the logic is flawed: it should always traverse left and right, and only print when it's a leaf. The condition blocks traversal for leaves, which is correct, but then prints the node even if it's not a leaf because the 'if (!isLeaf)' block doesn't prevent the print statement from executing for non-leaves. Actually, wait: if it's a leaf, it skips the if-block and prints. If it's not a leaf, it recurses and then prints — which is wrong because non-leaves shouldn't be printed. So the error is that non-leaf nodes are being printed.]
